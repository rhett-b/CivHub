# 🧠 Civic Protocol Registry

**CivHub’s Civic Protocol Registry** is a public, open-source reference library of civic processes—designed to make governance legible, modular, and remixable.

This is a reference implementation for open civic infrastructure: each protocol is structured in a machine-readable JSON format, with clear metadata, steps, and deployment logic that can be forked, iterated, or embedded by communities, developers, and institutions.

## ✨ What is a Civic Protocol?

A civic protocol is a repeatable process for democratic decision-making, participation, or administration. Examples include:

- Participatory budgeting
- Quadratic voting
- Community testimony workflows
- Public assembly procedures
- Allocation formulas
- Moderation logic for civic platforms

## 🧪 Why This Matters

We believe governance should be:
- **Legible**: People should be able to see and understand how decisions happen
- **Participatory**: Civic processes should be open to contribution and critique
- **Forkable**: Communities should be able to remix and improve their systems
- **Trustable**: Civic tools should be auditable and transparent by design

The Civic Protocol Registry is part of CivHub’s broader mission to prototype post-industrial, protocol-based governance.
