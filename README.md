# CivHub  

**CivHub** is an open-source platform for transparent governance and civic data. Our goal is to provide accessible, real-time insights into government decisions, public spending, and policies—empowering communities with information.  

## **What is CivHub?**  
CivHub is a decentralized system that collects, synthesizes, and visualizes government data. It aims to:  
- **Increase Transparency** – Give people clear, unbiased insights into governance.  
- **Enhance Accessibility** – Provide real-time and historical data in a user-friendly format.  
- **Encourage Civic Engagement** – Empower communities with knowledge and tools to take action.  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Data Collection** – Aggregates public data from government sources.  
2. **AI Analysis** – Processes and synthesizes the information.  
3. **Public Dashboard** – Presents insights in a clear, interactive format.  

## **Goals for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**  
✔️ Aggregate **Westchester County NY's** public government data.  
✔️ Create a **simple website** to showcase key insights.  
✔️ Develop an **AI-driven approach** to processing and displaying data.
